//Complete the function that takes an array of words.
//You must concatenate the nth letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where n is the position of the word in the list.

//For example:

//["yoda", "best", "has"]  -->  "yes"
 // ^        ^        ^
 // n=0     n=1     n=2
